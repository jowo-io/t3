# Install

To run this app entirely on localhost, you'll need to install a few bits and bobs. Docker is currently NOT configured.

### MySQL

### MySQL Workbench (optional)

# Env vars

`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` can be generated by running:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

# CloudFlare

Cors rules must be added (WIP):

```
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT"
    ],
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ]
  }
]
```

# Local network

The `npm run dev` development script is made available on the local IP. You can find it by running `ipconfig` in the command line.

```
$ ipconfig
```

Then look for the `Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi` section under the `IPv4 Address` section.

Be sure to update the `NEXTAUTH_URL` in the `.env` file too!
