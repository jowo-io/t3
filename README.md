# Install

To run this app entirely on localhost, you'll need to install a few bits and bobs. Docker is currently NOT configured.

### PostgresQL

### Postbird (optional)

https://github.com/Paxa/postbird

# railway.app

Env vars:

```conf
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=u+qwertyuiopQWERTYUIOP123456789/123abc=
NEXTAUTH_URL=${{RAILWAY_STATIC_URL}}
```

`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` can be generated by running:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

# CloudFlare

Cors rules must be added (WIP):

```
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT"
    ],
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ]
  }
]
```
